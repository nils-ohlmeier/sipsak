.SH DESCRIPTION
.B sipsak
is a SIP stress and diagnostics utility. 
It sends SIP requests to the server within the 
.BR sip-uri 
and examines received responses.
It runs in one of the following modes:
.IP "- default mode"
A SIP message is sent to destination in 
.BR sip-uri
and reply status is displayed. 
The request is either taken from
.BR filename
or generated as a new OPTIONS message.  
.IP "- traceroute mode (-T)"
This mode is useful for learning request's path. It
operates similarly to IP-layer utility
.BR traceroute (8).
.IP "- message mode (-M)"
Sends a short message (similar to SMS from the mobile phones) to a given target. With the option
.BR -B
the content of the MESSAGE can be set. Useful might be the options
.BR -c
and
.BR -O
in this mode.
.IP "- usrloc mode (-U)"
Stress mode for SIP registrar. 
.B sipsak
keeps registering to a SIP server at high pace. Additionally the registrar
can be stressed with the 
.BR -I
or the
.BR -M
option.
If
.BR -I
and
.BR -M
are omitted
.B sipsak
can be used to register any given contact (with the
.BR -C
option) for an account at a registrar and to query the current bindings for
an account at a registrar.
.IP "- randtrash mode (-R)"
Parser torture mode. 
.B sipsak 
keeps sending randomly corrupted messages to torture a SIP server's
parser.
.IP "- flood mode (-F)"
Stress mode for SIP servers.
.B sipsak 
keeps sending requests to a SIP server at high pace.

.PP
If c-ares 
(http://daniel.haxx.se/projects/c-ares/) support is compiled into the
.B sipsak
binary, then first a SRV lookup for _sip._tcp.hostname is made. If that
fails a SRV lookup for _sip._udp.hostname is made. And if this
lookup fails a normal A lookup is made. If a port was given in the target
URI the SRV lookup is omitted. Failover, load distribution and other 
transports are not supported yet.

.SH OPTIONS
.IP "-a, --password PASSWORD"
With the given 
.I PASSWORD
an authentication will be tried on received '401 Unauthorized'. Authorization
will be tried on time. If this option is omitted an authorization with an
empty password ("") will be tried. If the password is equal to 
.I -
the password will be read from the standard input (e.g. the keyboard). This
prevents other users on the same host from seeing the password
in the process list.
.B NOTE:
the password still can be read from the memory if other users have access to
it.

.IP "-A, --timing"
prints only the timing values of the test run if verbosity is zero because no 
.BR -v 
was given. If one or more 
.BR -v 
were given this option will be ignored.

.IP "-b, --appendix-begin NUMBER"
The starting number which is appended to the user name in the usrloc mode.
This 
.I NUMBER
is increased until it reaches the value given by the
.BR -e
parameter. If omitted the starting number will be one.

.IP "-B, --message-body STRING"
The given 
.I STRING
will be used as the body for outgoing MESSAGE requests.

.IP "-c, --from SIPURI"
The given
.I SIPURI
will be used in the From header if
.B sipsak
runs in the message mode (initiated with the
.BR -M
option). This is helpful to present the receiver of a MESSAGE a meaningful
and usable address to where maybe even responses can be sent.

.IP "-C, --contact SIPURI"
This is the content of the Contact header in the usrloc mode. This allows
to insert forwards like for mail. For example you can insert the uri of
your first SIP account at a second account, thus all calls to the second
account will be forwarded to the first account.
As the argument to this option will not be enclosed in brackets you can
give also multiple contacts in the raw format as comma separated list.
The special words 
.B empty
or
.B none
will result in no contact header in the REGISTER request and thus the server
should answer with the current bindings for the account at the registrar.
The special words 
.B *
or
.B star
will result in Contact header containing just a star, e.g. to remove all
bindings by using expires value 0 together with this Contact.

.IP "-d, --ignore-redirects"
If this option is set all redirects will be ignored. By default without this 
option received redirects will be respected. This option is automatically 
activated in the randtrash mode and in the flood mode.

.IP "-D, --timeout-factor NUMBER"
The SIP_T1 timer is getting multiplied with the given NUMBER. After receiving
a provisional response for an INVITE request, or when a reliable transport
like TCP or TLS is used
.B sipsak
waits for the resulting amount of time for a final response until it gives up.

.IP "-e, --appendix-end NUMBER"
The ending number which is appended to the user name in the usrloc mode.
This number is increased until it reaches this ending
.I number.
In the flood mode this is the maximum number of messages which will be sent. 
If omitted the default value is 2^31 (2147483647) in the flood mode.

.IP "-E, --transport STRING"
The value of
.I STRING
will be used as IP transport for sending and receiving requests and responses.
This option overwrites any result from the URI evaluation and SRV lookup.
Currently only 'udp' and 'tcp' are accepted as value for
.I STRING.

.IP "-f, --filename FILE"
The content of 
.I FILE
will be read in in binary mode and will be used as replacement for the
alternatively created sip message. This can used in the default mode to make
other requests than OPTIONS requests (e.g. INVITE). By default missing
carriage returns in front of line feeds will be inserted (use
.BR -L
to de-activate this function). If the filename is equal to 
.I -
the file is read from standard input, e.g. from the keyboard or a pipe.
Please note that the manipulation functions (e.g. inserting Via header)
are only tested with RFC conform requests. Additionally special strings
within the file can be replaced with some local or given values (see 
.BR -g
and
.BR -G
for details).

.IP "-F, --flood-mode"
This option activates the flood mode. In this mode OPTIONS requests with
increasing CSeq numbers are sent to the server. Replies are ignored --
source port 9 (discard) of localhost is advertised in topmost Via.

.IP "-h, --help"
Prints out a simple usage help message. If the long option
.BR --help
is available it will print out a help message with the available long options.

.IP "-g, --replace-string STRING"
Activates the replacement of $replace$ within the request (usually read 
in from a file) with the
.I STRING.
Alternatively you can also specify a list of attributes and values.
This list has to start and end with a non alpha-numeric character. The
same character has to be used also as separator between the attribute and
the value and between new further attribute value pairs. The string
"$attribute$" will be replaced with the value string in the message.

.IP "-G, --replace"
Activates the automatic replacement of the following variables in the
request (usually read in from a file):
.B $dsthost$ 
will be replaced with the host or domainname which is given
by the
.B -s
parameter.
.B $srchost$
will be replaced by the hostname of the local machine.
.B $port$
will be replaced by the local listening port of 
.B sipsak.
.B $user$
will be replaced by the username which is given by the
.B -s
parameter.

.IP "-H, --hostname HOSTNAME"
Overwrites the automatic detection of the hostname with the given parameter.
.B Warning: 
use this with caution (preferable only if the automatic detection fails).

.IP "-i, --no-via"
Deactivates the insertion of the Via line of the localhost. 
.B Warning: 
this probably disables the receiving of the responses from the server.

.IP "-I, --invite-mode"
Activates the Invites cycles within the usrloc mode. It should be combined
with
.BR -U.
In this combination 
.B sipsak 
first registers a user, and then simulates an 
invitation to this user. First an Invite is sent, this is replied with 200 OK
and finally an ACK is sent. This option can also be used without
.BR -U
, but you should be sure to NOT invite real UAs with this option. In the case
of a missing 
.BR -U
the
.BR "-l PORT"
is required because only if you made a 
.BR -U 
run with a fixed local port before, a run with
.BR -I
and the same fixed local port can be successful.
.B Warning: sipsak 
is no real UA and invitations to real UAs can result in unexpected 
behaviour.

.IP "-j, --headers STRING"
The
.BR string
will be added as one or more additional headers to the request. The string
"\\n" (note: two characters) will be replaced with CRLF and thus result
in two separate headers. That way more then one header can be added.

.IP "-J, --autohash STRING"
The
.BR string
will be used as the H(A1) input to the digest authentication response
calculation. Thus no password from the 
.BR -a
option is required if this option is provided. The given
.BR string
is expected to be a hex string with the length of the used hash function.

.IP "-k, --local-ip STRING"
The local ip address to be used

.IP "-l, --local-port PORT"
The receiving UDP socket will use the local network 
.I port.
Useful if a file is given by 
.BR -f
which contains a correct Via line. Check the 
.BR -S
option for details how sipsak sends and receives messages.

.IP "-L, --no-crlf"
De-activates the insertion of carriage returns (\\r) before all line feeds
(\\n) (which is not already proceeded by carriage return) if the input
is coming from a file (
.BR -f
). Without this option also an empty line will be appended to the request
if required.

.IP "-m, --max-forwards NUMBER"
This sets the value of the Max-Forward header field. If omitted no Max-Forward
field will be inserted. If omitted in the traceroute mode 
.BR number
will be 255.

.IP "-M, --message-mode"
This activates the Messages cycles within the usrloc mode (known from 
.B sipsak
versions pre 0.8.0 within the normal usrloc test). This option should be
combined with
.BR -U
so that a successful registration will be tested with a test message to the user
and replied with 200 OK. But this option can also be used without the
.BR -U
option.
.B Warning:
using without 
.BR -U
can cause unexpected behavior.

.IP "-n, --numeric"
Instead of the full qualified domain name in the Via line the IP of the
local host will be used. This option is now on by default.

.IP "-N, --nagios-code"
Use Nagios compliant return codes instead of the normal sipsak ones. This means
.B sipsak 
will return 0 if everything was ok and 2 in case of any error (local or remote).

.IP "-o, --sleep NUMBER"
.B sipsak 
will sleep for 
.BR NUMBER 
ms before it starts the next cycle in the usrloc mode. This will slow down
the whole test process to be more realistic. Each cycle will be still completed
as fast as possible, but the whole test will be slowed down.

.IP "-O, --disposition STRING"
The given
.BR STRING
will be used as the content for the Content-Disposition header. Without this
option there will be no Content-Disposition header in the request.

.IP "-p, --outbound-proxy HOSTNAME[:PORT]"
the address of the hostname is the target where the request will be sent to 
(outgoing proxy). Use this if the destination host is different from the host
part of the request uri. The hostname is resolved via DNS SRV if supported
(see description for SRV resolving) and no port is given.

.IP "-P, --processes NUMBER"
Start
.BR NUMBER
of processes in parallel to do the send and reply checking. Only makes sense
if a higher number for 
.BR -e
is given in the usrloc, message or invite mode.

.IP "-q, --search REGEXP"
match replies against 
.BR REGEXP
and return false if no match
occurred. Useful for example to detect server name in Server header field.

.IP "-r, --remote-port PORT"
Instead of the default sip port 5060 the 
.BR PORT
will be used. Alternatively the remote port can be given within the sip uri of
the 
.BR -s
parameter.

.IP "-R, --random-mode"
This activates the randtrash mode. In this mode OPTIONS requests will be sent
to server with increasing numbers of randomly crashed characters within this
request. The position within the request and the replacing character are 
randomly chosen. Any other response than Bad request (4xx) will stop this
mode. Also three unresponded sends will stop this mode. With the 
.BR -t
parameter the maximum of trashed characters can be given.

.IP "-s, --sip-uri SIPURI"
This mandatory option sets the destination of the request. It depends on the
mode if only the server name or also a user name is mandatory. Example for a
full 
.BR SIPURI
: 
.I sip:test@foo.bar:123
See the note in the description part about SRV lookups for details how the 
hostname of this URI is converted into an IP and port.

.IP "-S, --symmetric"
With this option
.B sipsak
will use only one port for sending and receiving messages. With this option
the local port for sending will be the value from the
.BR -l
option. In the default mode
.B sipsak
sends from a random port and listens on the given port from the
.BR -l
option.
.B Note:
With this option
.B sipsak
will not be able to receive replies from servers with asymmetric signaling
(and broken rport implementation) like the Cisco proxy. If you run
.B sipsak
as root and with raw socket support (check the output from the
.BR -V
option) then this option is not required because in this case
.B sipsak
already uses only one port for sending and receiving messages.

.IP "-t, --trash-chars NUMBER"
This parameter specifies the maximum of trashed characters in the randtrash 
mode. If omitted 
.BR NUMBER
will be set to the length of the request.

.IP "-T, --traceroute-mode"
This activates the traceroute mode. This mode works like the well known
.BR traceroute(8) 
command expect that not the number of network hops is counted rather
the number of servers on the way to the destination user. Also the round trip
time of each request is printed out, but due to a limitation within the
sip protocol the identity (IP or name) can only be determined and printed
out if the response from the server contains a warning header field. In this
mode on each outgoing request the value of the Max-Forwards header field is
increased, starting with one. The maximum of the Max-Forwards header will be 255
if no other value is given by the 
.BR -m
parameter. Any other response than 483 or 1xx is treated as a final response
and will terminate this mode.

.IP "-u, --auth-username STRING"
Use the given
.BR STRING
as username value for the authentication (different account and 
authentication username).

.IP "-U, --usrloc-mode"
This activates the usrloc mode. Without the 
.BR -I
or the
.BR -M
option, this only registers users at a registrar. With one of the above
options the previous registered user will also be probed, wether with a
simulated call flow (invite, 200, ack) or with an instant message 
(message, 200). One password for all users accounts within the usrloc test 
can be given with the 
.BR -a
option. A user name is mandatory for this mode in the 
.BR -s
parameter. The number starting from the 
.BR -b
parameter to the 
.BR -e
parameter is appended the user name. If the 
.BR -b
and the
.BR -e
parameter are omitted, only one run with the given username, but without 
append number to the usernames is done.

.IP "-v, --verbose"
This parameter increases the output verbosity. No
.BR -v
means nearly no output except in traceroute and error messages. The maximum
of three v's prints out the content of all packets received and sent.

.IP "-V, --version"
Prints out the name and version number of 
.B sipsak
and the options which were compiled into the binary.

.IP "-w, --extract-ip"
Activates the extraction of the IP or hostname from the Warning header field.

.IP "-W, --nagios-warn NUMBER"
Return Nagios warn exit code (1) if the number of retransmissions before
success was above the given number.

.IP "-x, --expires NUMBER"
Sets the value of the Expires header to the given number.

.IP "-z, --remove-bindings"
Activates the randomly removing of old bindings in the usrloc mode. How many 
percent of the bindings will be removed, is determined by the 
USRLOC_REMOVE_PERCENT define within the code (set it before compilation).
Multiple removing of bindings is possible, and cannot be prevented.

.IP "-Z, --timer-t1"
Sets the amount of milliseconds for the SIP timer T1. It determines the
length of the gaps between two retransmissions of a request on a unreliable
transport. Default value is 500 if not changed via the configure option
--enable-timeout.

.SH RETURN VALUES
The return value 0 means that a 200 was received. 1 means something else 
than 1xx or 2xx was received.
2 will be returned on local errors like non resolvable names or
wrong options combination. 3 will be returned on remote errors like socket 
errors (e.g. icmp error), redirects without a contact header or simply 
no answer (timeout).

If the 
.BR -N
option was given the return code will be 2 in case of any (local or remote)
error. 1 in case there have been retransmissions from
.B sipsak
to the server. And 0 if there was no error at all.
.SH CAUTION
Use
.B sipsak
responsibly. Running it in any of the stress modes puts
substantial burden on network and server under test.

.SH EXAMPLES
.IP "sipsak -vv -s sip:nobody@foo.bar" 
displays received replies.
.IP "sipsak -T -s sip:nobody@foo.bar" 
traces SIP path to nobody.
.IP "sipsak -U -C sip:me@home -x 3600 -a password -s sip:myself@company"
inserts forwarding from work to home for one hour.
.IP "sipsak -f bye.sip -g '!FTAG!345.af23!TTAG!1208.12!' -s sip:myproxy"
reads the file bye.sip, replaces $FTAG$ with 345.af23 and $TTAG$ with
1208.12 and finally send this message to myproxy

.SH LIMITATIONS / NOT IMPLEMENTED
Many servers may decide NOT to include SIP "Warning" header fields.
Unfortunately, this makes displaying IP addresses of SIP servers
in traceroute mode impossible.

IPv6 is not supported.

Missing support for the Record-Route and Route header.

.SH BUGS
sipsak is only tested against the SIP Express Router (ser) though their could
be various bugs. Please feel free to mail them to the author.
